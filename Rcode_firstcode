# This is my first code in R!

# functions used today:
# plot (obviously plots the data with arguments x,y)
# data.frame (creates data frames, tightly coupled collections of variables which share many of the properties of matrices and of lists, used as the fundamental data structure)
# write.table (prints its required argument x (after converting it to a data frame if it is not one nor a matrix) to a file or connection)
# read.table (for importing data, Reads a file in table format and creates a data frame from it, with cases corresponding to lines and variables to fields in the file)
# summary (used to produce result summaries of the results of various model fitting functions)
# hist (hist computes a histogram of the given data values)



# Here are the input data
## examples from students in class
## using arrow <- to assign a function to an object 
# Costanza data streams
water <- c(100, 200, 300, 400, 500)
water

# Marta data fishes genomes
fishes <- c(10, 50, 60, 100, 200)
fishes

# now plot the diversity of fishes (y) vs the amount of water (x)
# funtcion is used with arguments inside, the xy
plot(water, fishes)

# the data can be stored in a table which is called data frame in R

streams <- data.frame(water, fishes)
streams # see detailed information about stream data frame



# Now we are going to import and/or export data

# For Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Mandriva) users
setwd("~/lab/")

# setwd for Windows, Always use this one
# setwd("C:/lab/")

# setwd Mac
# setwd("/Users/yourname/lab/")

# Let's export the table
# https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.6.2/topics/write.table
write.table(streams, file="my_first_table.txt")

# Some colleagues send us a table but how to import it in R?
read.table("my_first_table.txt")
# let's assign it to an object inside R
ducciotable <- read.table("my_first_table.txt") # always use ".." when going outside R

# the first statistics for lazy people
summary(ducciotable)

# Marta doesn't  like water
# Marta wants to get info only on fishes
# use $ to specifically exclude and look at a certain component of the data
summary(ducciotable$fishes)


# histogram plotting of only fishes/water
hist(ducciotable$fishes)
hist(ducciotable$water)
